Cyber Magazine looks at some of the websites, apps and code that allow regular web users to investigate bugs and hacks using open-source intelligence

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) has become an increasingly valuable tool for organisations, businesses, and individuals like us who want to know what's happening. 

With the vast amount of online information, knowing where to start and how to make sense of it all can be difficult. OSINT provides a way to collect and analyse publicly available data, which can then be used to make informed decisions or satisfy your curiosity.

Below we look at 10 of the leading open-source OSINT sites, services, and code - including search engines and data visualisation tools - that are available to us all. To clarify, we're not responsible for anything that can be done on these sites. Be careful out there.
